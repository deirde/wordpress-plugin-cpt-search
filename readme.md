# WORDPRESS-PLUGIN-CPT-SEARCH #

A simple WordPress plugin providing search features for a given custom post type.

It provides 3 shortcodes:

- [cpt_search_form] renders the search form.
- [cpt_search_results] renders the search results.
- [cpt_single_details] renders the details of the selected item.

There's no settings page in the backend yet, the custom post type name can be only changed inside the class.
